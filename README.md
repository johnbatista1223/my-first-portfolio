# Batista's-portfolio

## Description
This project is my first portfolio i ever created, my motivation was to create a nicely designed web page that included some cool animations using css to the best of my knowledge.The reason i built the project was to hopefully later on use this to get a job. its always good when you have a nice design to show off all your work.I used semantic elements and complex css to complete this project. From this specific project i learned how to properly use complex css properties and to comprehend how to style a web page.
